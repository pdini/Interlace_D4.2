The component testing of the platform was performed only at an essential level, as reported in deliverable D3.2 \cite{INTERLACE_D32}, due to lack of time and funding. Not having had the time to perform the component acceptance testing, we did could not perform the field tests either. We expect the component testing to be completed sometime in 2019 and the field testing probably in 2020. All updates will be shared on GitHub\footnote{\url{https://github.com/InterlaceProject/InterlaceBlockchain}} and/or on the project's webpage.\footnote{\url{https://www.interlaceproject.eu/}} 

Here we add a few words on the commercialisation plan, which has evolved significantly over the past few years.
